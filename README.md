# Bedwars Timers

This is a simple static site I made to track resource spawning in Minecraft
Bedwars. I've been playing it a lot with my friends recently, and it's useful to
be able to tell how e.g. how many emeralds have spawned so far in the current
round (so we know how many the other teams might have) and when the next set
will spawn.

It's also my first time making a website, so I'll probably keep changing and
improving it if I have time, since I'm trying to learn more about how web
development works.

### How to use it

This is a static site. Just clone the repo and host it however.

At the moment the default spawn tables in `js/config.mjs` are meaningless. You
will need to edit them first.
